# 1.9.2

- The FlutterDevices list now has new actions and also a new default.
  It will now use the `workspaceState` as the default location to store the selected device.

- Fixed flutter output channel being empty when reloading the extension.

# 1.9.0

- Added device selection for `flutter.run`.
- FlutterDevices list no longer runs the app but instead selects the device to run on.
- Started tracking changes in this changelog.
