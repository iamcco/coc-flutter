## Install

`:CocInstall coc-flutter`

> **NOTE**: install `dart-vim-plugin` plugin if your (neo)vim detect filetype incorrect

Most likely the extension will find your sdk automatically as long as the `flutter` command maps to an sdk location on your system.

If you are using a version manager like `asdf` that maps the `flutter` command to another binary instead of an sdk location or this extension cannot find your sdk for another reason you'll have to provide the extension with how to find your sdk.
To do this there are a few options:
1. If your version manager supports a `which` command like then you can set the `flutter.sdk.flutter-lookup` config option. Eg. `"flutter.sdk.flutter-lookup": "asdf which flutter"`.
2. You can add the path where to find the sdk to the `flutter.sdk.searchPaths` config option.
   Either specify the exact folder the sdk is installed in or a folder that contains other folders which directly have an sdk in them. *Note that not all of these folders need to have an sdk, if they don't contain one they will simply be ignored*
3. Set the `flutter.sdk.path` config option to the exact path you want to use for your sdk.
   If you have also set the `flutter.sdk.searchPaths` then you can use the `FlutterSdks` list (see below) to see what versions you have installed and set the config option for you. **Note that this means that the `flutter.sdk.path` option will be overriden by this list**

## Running the app

When the extension starts and has found an sdk it will request from flutter the available devices.
The device it will run the app on will be shown in the statusbar and can be changed using the `FlutterDevices` list.
If you call `flutter.run` with an explicit `-d deviceId` argument then the selected device will be ignored.

After making sure that the correct device is selected you can run the app by calling the `flutter.run`:
> :CocCommand flutter.run

If you want to give arguments to the flutter run command you can simply append them:
> :CocCommand flutter.run -t lib/main.dart --flavor myflavor


## coc-list sources

- FlutterSdks
  > `:CocList FlutterSdks`

  Shows all the sdks that can be found by using the `searchPaths` config and the `flutter-lookup` config options and allows you to switch between them, either only for your current workspace or globally.
  Besides those two ways to find sdks it also checks if you are using fvm and if so uses those directories to find your sdk.
  *You can disable this using the `flutter.fvm.enabled` config option.*

  You can also use this list to see what your current sdk is since it will have `(current)` behind it clearly.

- FlutterDevices
  > `:CocList FlutterDevices`

  Shows a list of available devices that can be selected to use as run destination.
  When selecting a device it will by default be stored in the `workspaceState` such that a device can be selected on a per project basis.
  If no device is stored yet in the `workspaceState` it will fall back to the `globalState` and otherwise simply use the first device reported by flutter.
  It also has the `run` action which only runs the app once on that device without changing the selected device.

  You can configure the default action that us used using the `flutter.devicesDefaultAction` config option as described below.

- FlutterEmulators
  > `:CocList FlutterEmulators`

  Shows emulators available to start.

## Settings

  > Enable coc-flutter extension

- `flutter.lsp.debug` default: `false`
  > Enable debug for language server

- `flutter.lsp.initialization.onlyAnalyzeProjectsWithOpenFiles`: default: `true`
  > When set to true, analysis will only be performed for projects that have open files rather than the root workspace folder.

  > When set to false, completion will not include synbols that are not already imported into the current file

  > When set to true, will display closing labels at end of closing, only neovim support.

- `flutter.sdk.searchPaths` default: `[]`
  > the paths to search for flutter sdks, either directories where flutter is installed or directories which contain directories where flutter versions have been installed
  > eg. `/path/to/flutter` (command at `/path/to/flutter/bin/flutter`) or
  > `~/flutter_versions` (command at `~/flutter_versions/version/bin/flutter`).

- `flutter.sdk.dart-command` default: `''`
  > dart command, leave empty should just work

- `flutter.sdk.dart-lookup` default: `''`
  > (**only use this if you don't have a flutter installation but only dart**) command to find dart executable location, used to infer dart-sdk location

- `flutter.sdk.flutter-lookup` default: `''`

  >  Vim command to open dev log window, like: `botright 10split`

- `flutter.workspaceFolder.ignore` default: `[]`

  > The default action to use when pressing enter in the `FlutterDevices` list.
  > The `state` options will store the selected device in coc's `memos.json` file.
  > The `config` options will store the selected device in the `coc-settings.json` file.

**Enable format on save**:

```jsonc
"coc.preferences.formatOnSaveFiletypes": [
  "dart"
],
```

## Code Actions

Add below config mapping

> this config should be in the coc.nvim README

``` vim
xmap <leader>a  <Plug>(coc-codeaction-selected)
nmap <leader>a  <Plug>(coc-codeaction-selected)
```

Applying codeAction to the selected region.

Example: `<leader>aap` for current paragraph, `<leader>aw` for the current word

Then you will see action list:

- Wrap with Widget
- Wrap with Center
- etc
